# Iris-ML-Model
This project focuses on deploying machine learning models using Python and Streamlit. It involves building a classification app that predicts flower types based on characteristics like petal and sepal dimensions. The project follows a structured approach:
- Model Development: Using a random forest classifier, the model is trained on the Iris dataset.
- Streamlit Integration: A user-friendly web application is created to allow real-time predictions.
- Deployment: The trained model is loaded into the app, enabling users to interact with it dynamically.
